This project is made as an inside joke, so support will be limited. 

### Required components for pcb

Component | Disorder30 | Disorder30 extended
| --- | --- | --- |
| DO-35 or SOD123 1N4148 Diodes | 31 | 38-39 |
| Pro Micro or other compatible mcu | 1 | 1 |
| MX Switches | 30-31 | 37-39 |
| 2u Stabilizer | 2 | 2-3 |
| EC11 Encoder (optional) | 1 | 1 |
| SSD1306 128x32 0.91" OLED (optional) | 1 | 1 |

### Case

Very simple top mount case (untested by me).
If pro micro is socketed, 5mm or lower sockets are recommended
Assembly requires 10-12 countersunk 6mm M2 screws depending on pcb model.
